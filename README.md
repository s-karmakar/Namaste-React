most imp> bundeler > webpack parcel vite
in our project we are going to use parcel

npm install -D parcel > -D for dev dependency
dependency > diff between dev and prod dependency

"parcel": "^2.13.3" > this is caret sign and we can put tilde ~ here
this helps in version management

    ^ automatic minor upgrade to 2.13.4 or
    ~ automatic major upgrade to 2.55 or 3.0

-- we should put package-lock and package.json in git

node modules should not be put in git

package-lock.json vs package.json [43.44 min]

# working in local but not in prod

    package.json: configuration file for npm
    > lock.json:  exact version - same versions needs to be deployed in prod

transitive dependecy or meta dependecy > bundelers need help of other packages as well

every dependency has its own package.json > inside node modules > all library has its own dependencys like dependecy tree

npm i > or npm install creates node_modules

# npx parcel index.html [give the entry point]

npx > executing a package

cdn links for react is not a good option as it is a costly operation to get react and react dom from unpkg

React element and html element

## React.createElement == React element = JS object > html element (render method)

    JSX & React is different
        jsx & React code combined is not pure JS
        JS Engine doesnot understand JSX
        parcel using help of Babel to transpile the JSX code to React code

## JSX => (Babel) React.createElement => RectElementy - JS Object => render method converts the code to html element

        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

        const jsxHeading = <h1>This is heading from JSX ðŸš€</h1>;


        root.render(jsxHeading);

what is shadow Root?

## EP3 Notes

    <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

// const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading1" }, "Hello World ");

//React Element

//React Componet
//class component => older way => uses JS Classes
//functional component => newer way => uses JS Functions == normal JS functions

// imp > any React Component should start with Capital letter...
// a funtion which returing some piece of React element or we can say some JSX code is react function component

const JsxHeading = () => <h1>This is heading from JSX ðŸš€</h1>;

const JsxHeading2 = function () {
return <h1>This is heading from JSX ðŸš€</h1>;
};
//jsxHeading2 and jsxHeading are same

const HeadingComponent = () => {
return (
<>
<JsxHeading />
<JsxHeading></JsxHeading>
{JsxHeading()}
{/_ calling function component > component inside component > component composition _/}

<h1>This is heading one from Component ðŸš€</h1>
{100 + 200} {/_ we can write JS inside js using {} _/}
{/_ {jsxHeadingElement} _/}
<h2>This is heading two from Component ðŸš€</h2>
</>
);
};

const jsxHeadingElement = (

  <h1>
    This is heading from JSX react elementðŸš€
    {/* {HeadingComponent()} */}
  </h1>
);
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(jsxHeadingElement);

// root.render(<HeadingComponent />);

// React element > simple JS object
// React component > just making the same react element or JS object into arrow function

// any other simple function which is returning some JSX code is also a React component
//we can use {} to write any JS inside JSX
//also to include any react element inside another react element
//also to include any react component inside another react component
//React component should return only one parent element

//React component composition > calling one component inside another component
// JSX sanitizes data before executing it
//{data} => data inside {} will be sanitized known as JSX sanitization => prevent cross site scripting attack => XSS attack => preventing attacker to run any malicious code on our website/browser...
// JSX sanitization is done by React itself

// bellow 3 component call are same
// <JsxHeading />
// <JsxHeading></JsxHeading>
// {JsxHeading()} > function call inside curly braces... as above functions are simple JS functions at the end of the day
